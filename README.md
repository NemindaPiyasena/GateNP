This is an extension of JOSH opearting system, extended by me to display hardware information on my PC.
Type lscmd at the begining of the shell to get the commands that you can use with this.
Enjoy and try to develop it more to have more functionalities.
The credit for originally designing and implementing JOSH goes for the author of: https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~yagel/dolev/MinimalOS/josh/# GateNP
